You are now working in **unattended roadmap mode** for approximately 30 minutes.

Your objective is to make measurable progress on uncompleted items from `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Instructions

1. **Read and analyze** `docs/ROADMAP.md` to identify all uncompleted tasks (marked with `[ ]`)

2. **Prioritize tasks** based on:
   - Foundation before features (earlier phases first)
   - Unblocking other tasks (dependencies)
   - Quick wins that provide immediate value
   - Tasks that can be completed in isolation

3. **Work autonomously** for ~30 minutes:
   - Focus on completing multiple small-to-medium tasks rather than one large task
   - If a task requires more than 10 minutes, break it down or move to the next task
   - Make reasonable implementation decisions without asking for approval
   - If you encounter a blocker, document it and move to the next task
   - Prioritize breadth of progress over perfection

4. **Update the roadmap as you go**:
   - Mark tasks as `[x]` immediately after completing them
   - Use the Edit tool to update `docs/ROADMAP.md`
   - Keep the roadmap synchronized with your progress

5. **Time management**:
   - Work efficiently - aim to complete 5-10 small tasks or 2-3 medium tasks
   - After 25-30 minutes, wrap up the current task and provide a summary
   - Don't start new complex tasks after 25 minutes

6. **Quality standards**:
   - All code must follow project conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
   - Backend: Use reactive programming (Mono/Flux)
   - Frontend: Use TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
   - Test your changes if possible (but don't let testing block progress)
   - Commit changes as you complete logical units of work

7. **Focus areas** (in priority order):
   - Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (critical for everything else)
   - Phase 2: Backend Core (enables frontend development)
   - Phase 3: Frontend Foundation (enables UI development)
   - Later phases as time permits

8. **At the end**, provide a concise summary:
   - Tasks completed (with links to files modified)
   - Tasks attempted but blocked (with reasons)
   - Next recommended priorities
   - Total time spent

## Working Style

- Be autonomous and decisive
- Favor action over deliberation
- Make reasonable assumptions and document them
- Skip tasks that require external decisions or resources
- Focus on concrete, verifiable deliverables
- Update documentation as you go

## Begin

Start by reading `docs/ROADMAP.md`, creating a todo list of tasks to work on, and then begin implementation.
